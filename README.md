# Etch-A-Sketch

This is a project to create an etch-a-sketch type app.
Using divs that change color when the mouse is hovered over.

To start this project, I will only be creating a 16 X 16 grid.
But, I'll only be using flexbox.

In the end, of this part, every box will be exactly equal sized,
and when hovered, as stated above, the divs will change colors.

There will also be a button to reset the divs to be blank.
